{"name":"Deluminate","tagline":"Web page for the Deluminate Chrome extension","body":"Deluminate is an extension for Google Chrome (and Chromium) that inverts the \r\nluminance of websites to make them easier on the eyes.\r\n\r\n**Warning:** because of the way this extension inverts the luminance of\r\nrendered pages, it may cause noticeable slowdowns for some users. If this\r\nhappens, you may prefer another extension that uses custom CSS to set the\r\ndefault background and text color of web pages.\r\n\r\nDetails\r\n-------\r\n\r\nInvert the brightness of the web without changing the colors! Useful as a night\r\nmode to darken most bright web sites (like Google), or just for making the web\r\nsoothing black instead of glaring white. Similar to the \"High Contrast\"\r\nextension by Google, but tries not to ruin images by blowing out the contrast or\r\nchanging the colors. It also offers a low-contrast mode and three strategies\r\nfor dealing with images, configurable on a per-domain basis!\r\n\r\n### Invert Everything ###\r\nIn this mode, the luminance is inverted on everything, including all images.\r\n\r\n### Keep Images Normal ###\r\nIn this mode, the plugin tries to avoid inverting the luminance on all images.\r\nUseful for websites that make strange decisions about image types (e.g., using\r\nPNGs for photos).\r\n\r\n### Smart Invert Images ###\r\nThe default--this mode tries to intelligently choose whether images should be\r\ninverted or not based on the following criteria:\r\n\r\n * Avoid inverting videos.\r\n * Since PNGs and GIFs are often used as stylistic elements and logos, they are\r\n   typically safe to invert without looking strange. These images are detected\r\n   by their file extensions.\r\n * Other images (in particular JPEGs) are typically photos that are often\r\n   unrecognizable when inverted, so avoid inverting these.\r\n\r\n### Low Contrast ###\r\nThis mode does not invert the luminance of the site. It only lowers the\r\ncontrast. Useful for sites that are mostly dark but have large, bright sections\r\nthat are distracting.\r\n\r\n### Dim ###\r\nThis mode does not invert the luminance of the site. It lowers the brightness\r\nonly.\r\n\r\nInstallation\r\n------------\r\n\r\nThe latest release is always available on the Chrome Web Store. Search for\r\n\"Deluminate\". Deluminate always supports the latest stable version Chome.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
